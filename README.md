User Authentication and Authorization Microservice:

This microservice is responsible for managing user authentication and authorization within the platform. It provides the following functionalities:

User Registration:

Route: POST /api/register
Description: Allows users to register for an account by providing necessary information such as name, email, and password.
Behavior: The microservice validates the provided data, creates a user account, and stores the information in the database. After successful registration, the user receives an access token.
User Login:

Route: POST /api/login
Description: Enables registered users to securely log in to their accounts using their credentials (email and password).
Behavior: The microservice verifies the user's credentials in the database, and if they are valid, generates an access token for the login session.
Role and Permission Management (for Admins):

Routes: POST /api/admin/roles and POST /api/admin/permissions
Description: These routes are accessible only by administrators and allow them to define custom roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the application.
Behavior: Administrators can create, update, or delete roles and associate specific permissions with them. This enables granular management of who can do what within the platform.
The microservice can be implemented using a web framework like Express.js and a JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication system to ensure the security and authenticity of requests. Additionally, a database such as MongoDB or PostgreSQL can be used to store user information, roles, and permissions.
